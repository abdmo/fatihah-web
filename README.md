<h1>About The App</h1>
<ul>
<li>The app url: www.revisiting-fatihah.com</li>
<li>This is just a side project I embarked on to get experience on how web design feels like. The contents are mostly from the notes that I took from Ustadh Nouman Ali Khan's lecture on Surah Al-Fatihah.</li>
<li>Please consider contributing to the code. Some user reported formatting errors, and I don't believe the css is robust enough to cater various screen sizes. Please leave me a note if you can help!&nbsp;</li>
<li>Thank you.&nbsp;<img src="https://html-online.com/editor/tinymce/plugins/emoticons/img/smiley-smile.gif" alt="smile" /></li>
